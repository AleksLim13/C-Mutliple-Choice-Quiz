# C-Mutliple-Choice-Quiz
This is a multiple choice quiz framework as easy asjustable to any use case.  The main classes are _2018Movies.cs, GameSignUp.cs, Movie.cs, MoviesLoader.cs, MultipleChoices.cs, Player.cs, Round.cs, Scores.cs, RoundsManager.cs, MainPage.xamls.cs. The data beans are Player.cs, Movie.cs, and _2018Movies.cs. All data beans classes have full CRUD and a master list field in their respective classes. MoviesLoader.cs aggregates _2018Movies.cs and Movie.cs. MultipleChoices.cs is an independent class. It has data fields for 4 different options and stores the question and answer as well. GameSignUp.cs uses Player.cs and takes a nickname as string from user to create a Player object so we can assign the current player elsewhere. Round.cs models different rounds which are just proposing a different question to a player. Data for Round is the current Player, score as right or wrong as 0 or 1, the question as a string, the anser as string, and the whole MultipleChoice.cs object as complete package. So Round.cs aggregates Player.cs, MultipleChoice.cs. RoundsManager.cs is a big aggregating class. He puts it all together and is designed this way for convenience so the programmer has only one var to work with for all main use cases.
